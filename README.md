# Applied Data Science Capstone
**Description:**
<br>
This project is part of IBM data science certification. The objective of the project is to predict the success of rocket launches from spaceX data.
We use spaceX API and web scraping to collect the data for analysis. Upon data collection, Exploratory Data Analysis is done to deep dive into the data. 
Later, data visualization is done to understand the relationship between the features. We also do geospatial analysis on the launch sites. We biuld interactive 
charts and graphs for quick analysis. We use four machine learining models(logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and K-nearest neighbours)
for prediction.<br><br>
